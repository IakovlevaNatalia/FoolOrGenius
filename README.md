## FoolOrGenius
**Fool or Genius** is a collection of six games developed during the learning process of WinForms technology.

-The project is implemented following the principles of object-oriented programming  
-To showcase user game scores retrieved from the MS SQL Server database, the WinForms control DataGridView was utilized  
-To enhance modularity, increase code reusability, the Dependency Injection (DI) design pattern was employed  
-Base class Ball has been implemented, allowing other objects to inherit and override behavior
